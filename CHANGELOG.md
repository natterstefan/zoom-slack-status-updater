## Unreleased

## Features

- Resolves [#4](https://github.com/natterstefan/zoom-slack-status-updater/issues/4)),
  by adding new `zoomVerificationToken` option to config.
- Only the slack workspace matching the request's `headers.authorization` will
  be updated, not all anymore

## 0.2.0 (2020-05-24)

### Features

- optimised server error handling
- workspace config can contain `email` (optional). Only when `email` matches the
  response the slack status is updated
  (resolves [#1](https://github.com/natterstefan/zoom-slack-status-updater/issues/1))

### Chore

- added travis and tests
- added `now.json` to `.gitignore` as it should be possible to customize it
  without creating a diff

## 0.1.0 (2020-04-12)

### Features

- initial setup with multiple slack workspaces support and now.sh deployment
